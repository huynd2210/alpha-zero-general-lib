# Othello example README

This folder contains the Othello game as an example to try the library.

Included is an implementation of the neural net
* for keras, that runs in Tensorflow 2.2
* for pytorch, that runs in PyTorch 1.6.0

It is largely based on https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general/tree/master/othello/

Modifications are currently more or less cosmetic.
